SAVIC is routing scheme in wireless networks, which is implemented on the basis of INET (v 2.1.0) under the OMNeT++ (4.2) frameworkl.

OMNeT++ (https://omnetpp.org/) is OMNeT++ is an extensible, modular, component-based C++ simulation library and framework, primarily for building network simulators.


How to run SAVIC:

1. install Omentpp 4.2 (https://omnetpp.org/software/2012/03/26/omnet-422-released.html)
2. enter src folder, run make
3. SAVIC is in networklayer/manetrouting/


Good to know:

The scheme can be improved by modifications in 
- The proposed routing strategy is implemented in src/networklayer/manetrouting/VCap.cc 
- In order to changet the radio behavior in the cognitive raio networks, the parimary users' influences on secondary users are implemented in src/world/radio/ChannelControl.cc and ChannelAccess.cc
- Priamry users' activity is implemented in src/world/radio
